## Altitude Acclimatization Training

### Understanding Altitude Sickness

**Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)** occurs above 2,500m when body can't adjust to low oxygen. Symptoms:
- Headache
- Nausea, vomiting
- Dizziness
- Shortness of breath
- Fatigue

**Prevention is key:** Gradual ascent + fitness + proper hydration

### Breathing Exercises (Pranayama)

**1. Anulom-Vilom (Alternate Nostril Breathing):**
- Sit in Padmasana (lotus position)
- Close right nostril, inhale through left (5 seconds)
- Close left, exhale through right (5 seconds)
- Repeat 10 minutes daily
- **Benefits:** Increases lung capacity, oxygenates blood

**2. Kap

albhati (Skull Shining Breath):**
- Sit comfortably, exhale forcefully through nose
- Passive inhale, active exhale
- Do 50-100 rounds (2-3 sets)
- **Benefits:** Strengthens lungs, clears respiratory system

**3. Bhramari (Humming Bee Breath):**
- Deep inhale, exhale with humming sound
- Repeat 5-10 times
- **Benefits:** Calms mind, reduces anxiety

### Simulated Altitude Training (Optional)

**If accessible:**
- Visit high-altitude locations (3,000m+) for weekend treks
- Sleep at moderate altitude (2,000m+) 2-3 times before yatra
- Use hypoxic training masks (advanced users only)

## Introduction: Understanding the Inner Line Permit (ILP) for Adi Kailash

The **Inner Line Permit (ILP)** is a mandatory travel document required for all visitors to Adi Kailash, as the region falls near the Indo-Tibet border in a restricted area of Uttarakhand. This comprehensive guide walks you through the entire process of obtaining your ILP for a smooth pilgrimage experience.

## What is Inner Line Permit and Why is it Required?

The Inner Line Permit is a security clearance document mandated by the Indian government for travel to areas near international borders. For Adi Kailash, located in Pithoragarh district near the Tibet border, the ILP serves multiple purposes:

- **Border Security:** Regulating civilian movement in sensitive areas
- **Environmental Protection:** Limiting tourist footfall in ecologically fragile regions
- **Safety Monitoring:** Ensuring proper documentation for emergency situations
- **Cultural Preservation:** Managing visitor numbers to protect local culture

Without a valid ILP, you will not be permitted to travel beyond Dharchula checkpost.

## Eligibility Criteria

### Who Can Apply:
- **Indian citizens** only (foreigners not permitted)
- **Age limit:** 15-70 years (medical fitness certificate required for 60+)

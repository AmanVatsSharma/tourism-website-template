## What is Inner Line Permit (ILP)?

The **Inner Line Permit (ILP)** is a mandatory travel document required for all Indian citizens visiting certain restricted border areas of India, including the Adi Kailash region in Uttarakhand. This permit system was established under the **Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation Act of 1873** and continues to be enforced for national security reasons.

### Why is ILP Required for Adi Kailash?

The Adi Kailash region is located in **Pithoragarh district**, extremely close to the **Indo-Tibet (China) border**. The Indian government restricts access to this sensitive area to:

1. **National Security**: Prevent unauthorized entry near international border
2. **Strategic Control**: Monitor movement in border regions
3. **Ecological Protection**: Preserve fragile Himalayan ecosystem
4. **Cultural Preservation**: Protect local communities and traditions
5. **Safety**: Ensure travelers are adequately prepared for harsh conditions

**Important**: Without ILP, you **CANNOT** travel beyond Dharchula. All hotels, checkpoints, and authorities will demand this permit.

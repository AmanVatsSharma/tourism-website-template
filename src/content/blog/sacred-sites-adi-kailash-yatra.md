## Introduction

The journey to Adi Kailash is not just about reaching the peak‚Äîit's about experiencing a divine trail of sacred sites that make this pilgrimage truly transformative. From ancient Shiva temples to mystical glacial lakes, every stop holds deep spiritual significance.

## 1. Adi Kailash Peak (5,945m)

**The Crown Jewel**

The main destination, Adi Kailash (also called Chhota Kailash or Baba Kailash), is considered Lord Shiva's second abode after Mount Kailash in Tibet. The pyramid-shaped snow-covered peak resembles Mount Kailash and is revered as part of the Panch Kailash system.

**Spiritual Significance:**
- Believed to be where Ravan performed intense tapasya
- Mentioned in Mahabharata as the Pandavas' refuge during exile
- Darshan from Jolingkong base camp (5-6 hours trek)

**Best Viewing:** Early morning (6-8 AM) for clear views

## 2. Om Parvat (6,191m)

**Nature's Divine Symbol**

One of the most mystical phenomena in the Himalayas, Om Parvat naturally displays the sacred "‡•ê" (Om) symbol formed by snow depositions on its rock face. This miraculous sight can only be seen from specific angles.

**Why It's Special:**
- Natural formation, not man-made
